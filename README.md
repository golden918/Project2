# Project2
This is a project made in my CS-210 Class under professor Faisel Shakeel

This project is a conpound interest calculator and is made to show new people to investing how adding more money over time conpounds more interest than if you just put a chunk of initial money.

I think what I did particularly well was in making a text menu look clean and user friendly when with other projects it has looked way simpler.

I could inhance my code by adding a function to print and read on text files to save examples for later uses

I felt like this project was pretty easy maybe the investmentCalculator class and the for loops where a little challenging.

Ive recently been working on a little stock data fetching project and the menu orginazation from this project helped me make a cleaner project so far.

I made this project manageable by following the industry standard of how code should look and by making a class for Investment Calculator and using objects in main.
